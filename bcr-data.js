    "Incorrect: A persistent cough may be concerning but is not the strongest indication for urgent referral.",
    "Incorrect: Unexplained weight loss raises suspicion but requires additional symptoms for urgent referral.",

    "Correct: New onset haemoptysis is a key red flag symptom requiring urgent evaluation for lung cancer.",
    "Incorrect: Recurrent infections are common in COPD and other conditions but do not necessarily indicate malignancy."
