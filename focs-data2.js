    "A) It makes the RMP more positive",
    "B) It makes the RMP more negative",
    "C) It eliminates the RMP entirely",
    "D) It has no effect on the RMP",
    "E) None of the above"
  ],
  "correctIndex": 0,
  "explanations": [
    "Correct: Increased Na+ permeability allows more Na+ to enter the cell, driving the RMP closer to ENa, which is positive.",
    "Incorrect: Increased Na+ permeability would not make the RMP more negative.",
    "Incorrect: The RMP is altered but not eliminated by changes in Na+ permeability.",
    "Incorrect: Na+ permeability has a significant impact on the RMP.",
    "Incorrect: The RMP specifically becomes more positive with increased Na+ permeability."

  ],
  "correctIndex": 1,
  "explanations": [
    "Incorrect: Hyperpolarization moves the membrane potential further from the threshold, reducing excitability.",
    "Correct: Hyperpolarization makes it harder for the cell to reach threshold potential, decreasing excitability.",
    "Incorrect: Changes in membrane potential significantly affect action potential likelihood.",
    "Incorrect: Hyperpolarization does not prevent repolarization after an action potential.",
    "Incorrect: The primary effect is a decreased likelihood of action potential generation."

  "question": "Which factor primarily explains why the resting membrane potential (RMP) deviates from the equilibrium potential for K+ (EK)?",
  "options": [
    "A) The high permeability of the membrane to sodium (Na+)",
    "B) The electrogenic activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump",

  "correctIndex": 2,
  "explanations": [
    "Incorrect: Sodium permeability at rest is low, not high.",
    "Incorrect: The Na+/K+ ATPase pump contributes to RMP but does not explain the deviation from EK.",
    "Correct: The slight permeability of the membrane to sodium ions at rest causes the RMP to deviate from EK.",
    "Incorrect: The membrane is not equally permeable to sodium and potassium ions.",
    "Incorrect: The deviation specifically arises due to the slight sodium permeability."

  "correctIndex": 1,
  "explanations": [
    "Incorrect: Chloride ions are influenced by RMP but still play a role.",
    "Correct: Chloride ions passively distribute to maintain equilibrium based on the membrane potential primarily set by Na+ and K+.",
    "Incorrect: Chloride ions do not actively contribute via electrogenic pumping.",
    "Incorrect: Potassium, not chloride, generates the most significant diffusion potential.",
    "Incorrect: Chloride’s role is primarily passive and dependent on RMP."

  "correctIndex": 1,
  "explanations": [
    "Incorrect: Decreased intracellular K+ concentration reduces the driving force for K+, making EK less negative.",
    "Correct: EK shifts toward a more positive value as the intracellular K+ concentration decreases.",
    "Incorrect: EK is highly dependent on the intracellular/extracellular concentration ratio and does not remain constant.",
    "Incorrect: EK depends on both intracellular and extracellular K+ concentrations.",
    "Incorrect: EK specifically becomes more positive with decreased intracellular K+."

  "explanations": [
    "Incorrect: Increased Na+ permeability moves the membrane potential toward ENa, not EK.",
    "Correct: Enhanced Na+ permeability depolarizes the membrane, making it more positive as it shifts toward ENa.",

  "question": "What would happen to the resting membrane potential (RMP) if the Na+/K+ ATPase pump were inhibited?",
  "options": [
    "A) RMP would become more negative",

    "C) RMP would immediately depolarize to zero",
    "D) RMP would remain unchanged",
    "E) None of the above"
  ],
  "correctIndex": 1,
  "explanations": [
    "Incorrect: The RMP would become less negative, not more, due to loss of ion gradients.",
    "Correct: Inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump leads to a gradual loss of ionic gradients, causing the RMP to depolarize (become less negative) over time.",
    "Incorrect: Depolarization to zero would not happen immediately and depends on time and the extent of gradient loss.",
    "Incorrect: The RMP is highly dependent on the activity of the pump and would change if it were inhibited.",
    "Incorrect: The change in RMP is specifically due to the inhibition of the pump."
